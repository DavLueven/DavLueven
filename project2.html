        <h2>Artifact 2</h2>
	<h3>Narrative</h3>
	<p>The "Zoo Monitoring System" is a console-based tool I initially developed during
	 the Foundations in Application Development course in 19EW3. The system allows users to
	 access animal and habitat details, originally sourced from CSV files, presumably completed
	 by zoo staff. However, the initial method of parsing these files was overly intricate.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to viewing details, users can set alerts and action items, categorized by animal or
	 habitat type. These alerts serve as a task reminder for zookeepers, spotlighting any unusual
	 or significant issues. They remain as console notifications until manually cleared via
	 the menu.</p>
	
	<p>Recognizing the potential for enhancements, especially in algorithms and data structures, I
	 revisited this artifact. The original design provided opportunities for sorting, like arranging
	 animals by type or alphabetically. The need for improvements in the original code also
	 presented an appealing challenge after all these years.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 2: You DesignED, DevelopED, and DeliverED professional-quality oral, written,
	 and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific
	 audiences and contexts by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact 2 aligned with quality of communication by comprehensive commenting, including
	header comments with author, version, date and purpose. Added to this were DocString comments
	throughout, and clear menu navigation naming and error messaging.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 3: You DesignED and EvaluateED computing solutions that solve a given problem using
	 algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing
	 the trade-offs involved in design choices by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact 2 aligned with algorithmic principals by completely revamping the oringal mess of a menu into
	a less complex and more modular design, each module with specific algorithmic purpose, as well as using TimSort
	as an efficient way to include a structured view of entities for the user. TimSorts worst-case time complexity
	is O(n log n) which is fine here considering the limit of the zoo's capacity.</p>
