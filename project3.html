        <h2>Artifact 3</h2>
	<h3>Narrative</h3>
	<p>This artifact is a revised version of the final project from DAD-220:
	Introduction to Structured Database Environments, which I took back in 19EW6.
	This course was my first experience with SQL. The original project featured a
	MySql database named 'messaging' with three tables designed around athletes
	from diverse sports. The schema interconnected athletes using various IDs and
	linked them to images using other IDs, forming a cohesive data display through
	multiple queries.</p>
	
	<p>Given that DAD-220 inherently revolved around database projects, it was a
	natural choice for enhancement. While the original deliverable was a word document,
	comprising narratives and screenshots, this version needed a working database
	made from scratch. The former schema, with it's message_ids, contact_ids, and
	connection_ids, felt confused and unclear. So, I remade the schema to better go
	with the athletic theme, introducing distinct tables for sport types, teams, and
	athletes.</p>
	
	<p>Enhancing this artfact posed initial challenges. Starting with the oringal schema,
	it was clear that it's complexity would confuse users who without a intricate
	explanation. This prompted the change to the new, user-friendly schema. While
	recreating the database from scratch, I had a difficult time deciding what I should
	include and exclude, such as whether to include the full range of CRUD operations.
	I settled on a streamlined script that creates and populates the database and then
	demonstrates a few sample queries for demonstration purposes.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 1: You EmployED strategies for building collaborative environments
	 that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of
	 computer science by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact three aligns with building collaborative environments by using the portablitiy
	of SqLite within the scalability of Python.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 2: You DesignED, DevelopED, and DeliverED professional-quality oral,
	 written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately
	 adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact three aligns with quality of communication by providing immediate feedback
	through console outputs for actions like user creation, clearly defined database
	schema and code relationships, and extensive commenting, including header and DocStrings.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 4: You DemonstrateD an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques,
	 skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that
	 deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact three aligns with innovative techniques, skills and implementaion by
	SqLite explicit table creation, sample data insertion, data reset, all executed within a
	Python code structure.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 5: You DevelopED a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in
	 software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and
	 ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact three aligns with a security mindset by using the bcrypt module to hash passwords
	in the scripts authentication system.</p>

SQLite User Authentication and Database Query Script

This Python script provides functionality for user authentication and performing various database queries using SQLite.
It includes functions for user management, database initialization, data insertion, and querying. The script is designed
to be a template that can be used as a starting point for building applications that require user authentication
and database interaction.
