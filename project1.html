        <h2>Artifact 1</h2>
	<h3>Narrative</h3>
        <p>Artifact One comes from the final project of the Software Testing and Automation course
	 during the 22EW3 term here at SNHU. Built originally in Java, it comprises two integral classes:
	 the 'Appointment' and 'Appointment Service' classes. The former encapsulates an appointment's details,
	 including its date, time, description, and a unique identifier. Meanwhile, the 'Appointment Service'
	 class serves as the backbone for managing these appointment objects, offering CRUD (Create, Read,
	 Update, Delete) operations.</p>

	<p>I selected this artifact for inclusion because it transparently illustrates software engineering
	 principles and design. The appointment object's attributes, coupled with the CRUD functionalities,
	 effectively convey design and operational tenents. The integration of validation helper methods and
	 the transition to Python further highlight the compentencies and insights I've gained during my tenure at
	 SNHU and through external learning resources.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 2: You DesignED, DevelopED, and DeliverED professional-quality oral, written, and
	 visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences
	 and contexts by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact one aligned with quality of communication by including Docstring commenting, as well as explicit
	 error messages, and naming conventions of methods that make clear their singular responsibilities. There is also
	an emphasis on header commenting which includes details such as author's name, version number, date created,
	and purpose of the specific code file, ensuring clarity and transparency.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 3: You DesignED and EvaluateED computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic
	 principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs
	 involved in design choices by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact one aligned with algorithmic principals by use of modular validation methods and the clear
	implementation of encapsulation demonstrate an understanding of separation of functionalities and algrorithmic
	purpose. The choice of data structures, such as nested dictionaries, underscores a focus on algorithmic
	and data structure efficiency.This efficiency is highlighted by use of a nested dictionary to replace the use
	of an ArrayList, with the change in time complexity going from a potential of O(n) to O(1) with the new data
	structure.</p>

	<strong>Course Outcome 4: You DemonstrateD an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills,
	 and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and
	 accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact one aligns with innovative techniques, skills and implementations by use of the Python language and
	all it's many library extensions. The possiblity for expansion of data analysis and visual representations
	is expansive. Techniques like using regular expression validation with the "re" module ensure that data adheres
	to a specic format and is another example.</P>

	<strong>Course Outcome 5: You DevelopED a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software
	 architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and
	 enhanced security of data and resources by completing the following enhancements</strong>
	
	<p>Artifact one aligns with a security mindset by incorporating validation of input data, necessary for protecting
	against injection attacks. Other security measures include a less complex and more efficient way of
	generating unpredictable IDs, and encapsulation to reinforce controlled data access.</p>
